In this update the development team has been hard at work transitioning from the previously developed random dungeon generation to a new third-party framework 
called the Edgar Dungeon Generator.

This new dungeon generator will allow the development team to create a more controlled but rich evironment for the game and grants us the ability to create 
custom post processing functionality for the dungeons themselves, allowing for a more in depth incorporation of the random enemy/set objective gameplay goal we have set.

In this update we also began the transition from the current movement system to one utilizing a finite state machine for the player and enemies. 
This allows us to make much better use of Unity's new input system, and cut down on the long script architecture by dividing core gameplay features into their 
own states.

The dev team is hard at work on bringing a fully fledged and enjoyable experience to the table, so stay tuned!
