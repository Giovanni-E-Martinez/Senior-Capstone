## Introduction

### The idea:

This project is a 2D orthographic action adventure game. The design philosophy for the game environment and layout took inspiration from games in similar genres such as Metroid, where the player is dropped in a large space that they will be tasked with navigating. The core gameplay loop of the game will consist of selecting a loadout and objectives from a central hub area and proceeding to the larger environment, or map, where the player will have to complete those objectives and return safely by extracting from the map to collect their rewards. 

### The purpose:

The purpose of this project was to explore and experience the process of developing a game from the ground up. I wanted to learn about what it takes to create a concept for a game and then explore the different concepts and ideas that one can utilize when developing the groundwork for the game. Primarily, I wanted to explore the concept of creating a game that utilizes object oriented fundamentals like inheritence, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
