Repository for my CST-451 Senior Capstone project files and information.

This project is a 2D isometric action adventure game. The design philosophy for the game environment and layout will take inspiration from games in the genre such as Metroid, where the player is dropped in a large space that they will be tasked with navigating. The core gameplay loop of the game will consist of selecting a loadout and objectives from a central hub area and proceeding to the larger environment, or map, where the player will have to complete those objectives and return safely by extracting from the map to collect their rewards.
