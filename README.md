# Senior-Capstone
Repository for my CST-451 Senior Capstone project files and information.

This project is a 2D orthographic action adventure game. The design philosophy for the game environment and layout will take inspiration from games in the genre such as Metroid, where the player is dropped in a large space that they will be tasked with navigating. The core gameplay loop of the game will consist of selecting a loadout and objectives from a central hub area and proceeding to the larger environment, or map, where the player will have to complete those objectives and return safely by extracting from the map to collect their rewards. 

The current state of the game allows for the random generation of dungeon maps, with player movement and combat input. The development team is still hard at work on implementing the rest of the features. We hope you will root for and support the team as we embark on this journey of actively biting off more than we can chew even though we know it's detrimenatal to our mental and physical health and sanity.
